/*!@brief
 * The adal_base_open() interface is used to open a device and associate it
 * with an adal_t.  It must be the first interface called to ensure that the
 * device has been opened. The device is closed when the application
 * terminates or when adal_base_close() is called on the device.
 *
 * @post: When the device is opened it is configured with the default set of
 *       parameter values.  The adal_base_config() can be used to modify the
 *       device's operating characteristics.
 *
 * @post: When the device is opened, sizeof(adal_t) bytes is
 *       allocated on the caller's heap.
 *
 * @param: 'device' NULL-terminated string of the target device
 *        (i.e. /dev/<xxxx>/<n>).
 *
 * @param: 'flags' Optional device specific open flags, use 0 for the
 *        device default.  One of the required flags can be bitwise or'd
 *        with zero or more optional flags.
 *
 * @note: The low-level device drivers will support only the flags
 *        which are appropiate for the underlying device.
 *
 * @note   [Required]
 * @note    O_RDONLY    Open the device for read-only access.
 * @note    O_WRONLY    Open the device for write-only access.
 * @note    O_RDWR      Open the device for read and write access.
 *
 * @note   [Optional]
 * @note    O_EXCL      Request exclusive access to the device
 *                      (i.e. blocking single-threaded access).
 * @note    O_SYNC      Any write()'s on the device will block the caller until
 *                      the data has been physically written to the underlying
 *                      device.
 * @note    O_ASYNC     Generate a signal (SIGIO by default) when input or
 *                      output becomes possible on this device.
 * @note    O_NONBLOCK,
 * @note    O_NDELAY    The device is opened in non-blocking mode.  Neither
 *                      the open nor any subsequent operations on the device
 *                      will cause the caller to wait.
 *
 * @note    See 'man 2 open' for a details about all open flags.
 *
 * @return: Pointer to an adal_t on success, NULL on failure with errno set as
 *         follows.
 * @return: ENXIO The device in the /dev filesystem can not be found.
 * @return: EIO A low-level device driver or hardware I/O error occurred.
 * @return: EINVAL At least one of the input parameters is invalid.
 * @return: EBUSY The request would block waiting for the device,
 *         if O_NONBLOCK was specified in the 'flags' parameter.

 * The adal_base_close() interface is used to disassociate an adal_t from

 *
 * @note: Prior to closing the device, the adal_base_close() interface will
 *       ensure any buffered data is written to the device by calling the
 *       adal_base_flush() interface.
 *
 * @note: It's important to check the return code from the adal_base_close()
 *       interface because device operation errors are guaranteed to be
 *       returned as the return code from this interface.  Not checking
 *       the return code can lead to silent data lossage.

 *       or waiting for buffer space to become available for writing.
 *
 * @note: The adal_wait_t structure is a control block with the following
 *       definition:
 *
 *           typedef struct {
 *                      int   event;

 *           } adal_wait_t;

 * @note 'event' is the device event to "wait" for.
 *           ADAL_EVENT_WRITE - wait until a write to the device will not
 *                              block the calling thread (e.g. "buffer space"
 *                              is available).

 *                              block the calling thread (e.g. data is
 *                              available).
 * @note 'adal' is a pointer to the target ADAL device.
 *              if a NULL value is encountered, the call will return -1
 *              with errno set to EINVAL.
 * @note 'results' is the result of the operation, defined as:
 *          >0 if the event occured (will be set to event that occured)
 *           0 if the event did not occur before the timeout expired,
 *
