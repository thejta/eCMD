 * @brief	This interface is used to open a device and associate it with an
 *		adal_t. It must be the first interface called to ensure that the
 *		device has been opened. The device is closed when the application
 *		terminates or when adal_scom_close() is called on the device.
 *
 * @post	When the device is opened it is configured with the default set
 *		of parameter values.  The adal_scom_config() can be used to
 *		modify the device's operating characteristics.
 *
 * @post	When the device is opened, sizeof(adal_t) bytes is allocated on
 *		the caller's heap.
 *
 * @param	device	NULL-terminated string of the target device
 *			(i.e. /dev/scom/<n>).
 *
 * @param	flags	Optional device specific open flags, use 0 for the
 *			device default. One of the required flags can be bitwise
 *			or'd with zero or more optional flags.
 *
 * @note	The low-level device drivers will support only the flags which
 *		are appropriate for the underlying device.
 *
 * @note	[Required]
 * @note	O_RDWR	Open the device for read and write access.
 *
 * @note	[Optional]
 * @note	O_EXCL	Request exclusive access to the device
 *
 * @return	Pointer to an adal_t on success, NULL on failure with 'ERRNO'
 *		set as follows.
 * @return	ENXIO	The device in the /dev filesystem can not be found.
 * @return	EIO	A low-level device driver or hardware I/O error occurred.
 * @return	EINVAL	At least one of the input parameters is invalid.
 * @return	EBUSY	The request would block waiting for the device,
 *			if O_NONBLOCK was specified in the 'flags' parameter.
